        <h3>Project 1</h3>
        <h4>Title:Automatic shed system to off field crops from rains</h4>
        <p>Description:With the ongoing fourth revolution, technology has been growing rapidly day by day. 
            One of the most significant and efficient uses of this has been evident in the farming sector. 
            From a basic water sprinkler system to the requirement of Fertilizer for specific crops, the likes 
            of Artificial intelligence and the Internet of things have brought in great changes. One of the 
            issues which need to be addressed is the protection of crops from heavy rainfall which causes 
            significant damage to the crop production and soil yield, also causing huge mental distress to a 
            farmer. We in our proposed model have given a solution to this problem by giving automated as 
            well as manual control. The motivation behind our idea/project is to keep the crops protected 
            from these heavy precipitations and preserve the same rainwater for future purposes when water 
            is scarce. We use a Moisture sensor to ensure the covering of the estimated field and LCD 
            display to show status of Field.

            <p>Features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Feature 1: The system protects crops from excessive rainfall, minimizing the risk of waterlogging, diseases, and damage</li>
                <li>Feature 2: It leads to increased crop yield as plants can thrive in optimal conditions </li>
                <li>Feature 3: Farmers can better safeguard their investments and ensure a more stable income</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <h4>Title:SOLAR BASED WEATHER-ADAPTIVE E-UNIFORM</h4>
            <p>Description:This project introduces an innovative Intelligent Solar-Based E-Uniform, utilizing solar panels and a 12V DC rechargeable battery to power advanced circuitry controlled by the ATmega16a microcontroller. Operating in summer and winter modes, the uniform adjusts internal temperature, ensuring soldier comfort and optimal performance. It dynamically adjusts internal temperature to optimize soldier comfort and performance while incorporating fire resistance and Nanotechnology-Based Water Repellency for enhanced safety and durability. The metal sensor and buzzer alert system enhance situational awareness, detecting potential threats.
                GSM and GPS integration enable communication and real-time tracking, with location data sent to designated individuals or departments. Health monitoring adds a crucial dimension, alerting to abnormal health parameters for proactive care. Beyond military use, this technology extends to individuals unable to adapt to weather changes, providing a versatile solution for varied environmental conditions. The Intelligent Solar-Based E-Uniform addresses the evolving challenges faced by soldiers and diverse user groups, emphasizing comfort, safety, and adaptability.
